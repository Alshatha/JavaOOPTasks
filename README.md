✅ Java OOP Practice – Student Task Sheet
This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java through a series of structured tasks. Each concept is implemented in a separate .java file and includes proper class design, method use, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and interface implementation.

📌 Task Overview:
🔹 Task 1: Class and Object Basics
Created a Person class with name and age, and a display() method.

🔹 Task 2: Method in Class
Implemented a Rectangle class with a calculateArea() method.

🔹 Task 3: Constructor Overloading
Designed a Book class with overloaded constructors and displayInfo() method.

🔹 Task 4: Inheritance and Method Overriding
Defined Animal and Dog classes to demonstrate method overriding.

🔹 Task 5: Interface Implementation
Created a Shape interface and implemented it in Circle and Square classes using getArea().

🔹 Task 6: Encapsulation
Built a BankAccount class with private fields and public getter/setter methods.

🔹 Task 7: Abstract Class
Created an abstract Vehicle class and implemented the start() method in Car and Bike.

📁 Status:
✅ All tasks have been completed and Java source files are available in this repository.
